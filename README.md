# Transposon Truths: Identifying Essential Gene Domains in Yeast Using SATAY Data

This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing SATAY (SAturated Transposon Analysis in Yeast) data to identify essential gene domains in yeast. The analysis focuses on determining which regions in the genome are critical for survival based on transposon insertion patterns.
